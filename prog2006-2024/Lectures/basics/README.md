# Basics of programming

What is your most favourite programming language?
Why?

In your most favourite programming language:
1. Implement `if` -- conditional function. It will take three arguments, and returns the True_Expression if condition is true, and False_Expression if the condition is False.
2. Implement identity function -- Haskell's `id`. It takes a function or expression as an argument and returns it.
3. Implement a function that composes two functions `f` and `g`, that is, given two functions, it calls the the first one with the result of the second one.
4. The same as 3. but this time there is an arbitrary arity of parameters to the second one.
5. Write a function that given two functions, executes the first one, discards the result, and executes the second one, and returns the result.
6. Given a list of integers, write a function that sums them up.
7. Given a list of integers, write a function that adds 10 to each of them.


# Basics of Haskell

- Write a function that asks user for name, and prints "Hello <name>" to the screen.
- Do it with do-notation. Explain.
- Do it as one-liner.  Explain.
- Do it in your most favourite programming language. Compare your implementation with Haskell's one-liner.
