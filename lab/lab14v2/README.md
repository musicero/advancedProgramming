# Lab 14

I used rust for this lab. 

Eirik Hanasand generated some large test cases for fun, and shared them with me. This is to test the performance of the solution.

to run it, do cargo run --release




# The task

You have been given a map of floating islands at the start of your journey.
The map is provided in `data.txt` file. 

The map includes empty space (`.`) and islands (`#`). 
For example:

```
...#......
.......#..
#.........
..........
......#...
.#........
.........#
..........
.......#..
#...#.....
```
# expand empty
```
   v  v  v
 ...#......
 .......#..
 #.........
>..........<
 ......#...
 .#........
 .........#
>..........<
 .......#..
 #...#.....
   ^  ^  ^
```

# now twice as big
```
....#........
.........#...
#............
.............
.............
........#....
.#...........
............#
.............
.............
.........#...
#....#.......
```

# Get shortest path
```
....1........
.........2...
3............
.............
.............
........4....
.5...........
.##.........6
..##.........
...##........
....##...7...
8....9.......
```

Shortest path result of this map: 374
